This repo just aims to get you started with Anthropics Quickstarts environment to deploy "AI" hacking agents for shenanigans.

Why: On Oct 22, 2024 [Anthropic released ](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) and in part it states:

*"We‚Äôre also introducing a groundbreaking new capability in public beta: computer use. Available today on the API, developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do‚Äîby looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta."*

So in this repo, I am showing how the install guide leverages this to install metasploit, set options and execute an attack.

## Curious Notes

- on the VM in as the user home dir, there is a hidden directory called `~/.anthropic/` which I found two files:
    - `api_key`
    - `system_prompt`
   
        - The default state of the system prompt is blank, I had decent luck giving it instructions similar to "jailbreaks".
        - Documentation for this is here: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use
            - I had pretty good luck with it respecting these prompts prior to running the commands issues in the streamlit input field

           Interesting note: Even though its getting instruction to not intereact with external resources, it clearly ignores them.
          ya know.. since I was able to clone MSF and run it against something externally.

- I experienced this issue ["Claude sometimes assumes outcomes of its actions without explicitly checking their results. "](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use) with some of my commands dispite telling it:

  ```... Run each command one at a time and make sure they complete.  I want to see the output as you run the command.```
  
## Prerequisites

- [Read the docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use)
- Get your Anthropic API key from the [console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard)


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts.git
    #Then download my start_hacking.sh script here: https://github.com/NoDataFound/hackGPT/tree/main/hackthropic or just clone this entire repo
    git clone https://github.com/NoDataFound/hackGPT.git
    ```
    
2. Run the `start_hacking.sh` script: 
    ```bash
    hackGPT/hackthropic/start_hacking.sh #or whereever you saved it
    ```

## Environment Variables

Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY API key to `.env`  ` 

Format of the `.env` file:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

## Usage

The `start_hacking.sh` script will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Export environment variables from the `.env` file.
4. Run the Docker container with appropriate port bindings and environment variables.

## Notes

- Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
- The script drops the `.env` file in `anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/`.

## Want to Use Kali? üêâ

You are in luck dear haKCer, I made you a gift.  To move Just use the `Dockerfile` in the `kali/` directory and build your very own Kali instance to use instead of Anthropic's default image.

### Important Notes
- The container preserves your Anthropic configuration by mounting `~/.anthropic`
- The environment includes both GUI and CLI tools for security testing
- Claude maintains access to all computer use capabilities within the Kali environment

### Setup Process

1. **Pull the Kali Image**
   ```bash
   cd kali/
   docker pull kalilinux/kali-rolling
   ```

2. **Customize Your Environment**
   - The provided Dockerfile in this repo includes:
     - Essential GUI tools (VNC, noVNC)
     - Python environment setup
     - Common security tools
     - Desktop environment with basic applications

3. **Build Your Kali Container**
   ```bash
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 sudo docker build -t hakc-kali-image .
   or 
   docker build -t hakc-kali-image .
   ```

4. **Launch the Container**
   ```bash
    docker run \
        -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
        -v $(pwd):/home/hakcer/app \
        -p 5900:5900 \
        -p 8501:8501 \
        -p 6080:6080 \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        --name hakc-kali \
        -it hakc-kali-image
   ```

   Note: To stop the container just use `docker stop hakc-kali`

- **noVNC Web Access**: Available on port 6080
- **Streamlit Interface**: Available on port 8501
- **Web Services**: Available on port 8080
- **Anthropic Integration**: Uses your existing API key and settings
- **Persistence**: Mounts your local Anthropic config directory
