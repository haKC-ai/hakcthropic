This repo just aims to get you started with Anthropics Quickstarts environment to deploy "AI" hacking agents for shenanigans.

Why: On Oct 22, 2024 [Anthropic released ](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) and in part it states:

*"We‚Äôre also introducing a groundbreaking new capability in public beta: computer use. Available today on the API, developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do‚Äîby looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta."*

So in this repo, I am showing how the install guide leverages this to install metasploit, set options and execute an attack.

## Curious Notes

- on the VM in as the user home dir, there is a hidden directory called `~/.anthropic/` which I found two files:
    - `api_key`
    - `system_prompt`
   
        - The default state of the system prompt is blank, I had decent luck giving it instructions similar to "jailbreaks".
        - Documentation for this is here: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use
            - I had pretty good luck with it respecting these prompts prior to running the commands issues in the streamlit input field

           Interesting note: Even though its getting instruction to not intereact with external resources, it clearly ignores them.
          ya know.. since I was able to clone MSF and run it against something externally.

- I experienced this issue ["Claude sometimes assumes outcomes of its actions without explicitly checking their results. "](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use) with some of my commands dispite telling it:

  ```... Run each command one at a time and make sure they complete.  I want to see the output as you run the command.```
  
## Prerequisites

- [Read the docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use)
- Get your Anthropic API key from the [console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard)


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts.git && git clone https://github.com/haKC-ai/hakcthropic.git
    ```
2. Setup Environment Variables

   Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` API key to `.env` 

   ```bash
   mv hacking_sample.env .env
   read -sp "Enter your Anthropic API key: " apikey && echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$apikey" > .env
   ```
3. Rename some stuff
      ```bash
      cd kali/image
      mv removeME.streamlit .streamlit
      mv removeME.config .config
       ```

2. Run the `start_hacking.sh` script: 
    ```bash
    chmod 755 start_hacking.sh
    ./start_hacking.sh #or whereever you saved it
    ```




## Usage

The `start_hacking.sh` script will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Export environment variables from the `.env` file.
4. Run the Docker container with appropriate port bindings and environment variables.

## Notes

- Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
- The script drops the `.env` file in `anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/`.

You are in luck dear haKCer, I made you a gift.  To move Just use the `Dockerfile` in the `kali/` directory and build your very own Kali instance to use instead of Anthropic's default image.

### Important Notes
- The container preserves your Anthropic configuration by mounting `~/.anthropic`
- The environment includes both GUI and CLI tools for security testing
- Claude maintains access to all computer use capabilities within the Kali environment

### Setup Process

1. **Pull the Kali Image**
   ```bash
   cd haKC-ai/hakcthropic/kali
   docker pull kalilinux/kali-rolling
   ```

2. **Customize Your Environment**
   - The provided Dockerfile in this repo includes:
     - Essential GUI tools (VNC, noVNC)
     - Python environment setup
     - Common security tools
     - Desktop environment with basic applications

3. **Build Your Kali Container**
   ```bash
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 sudo docker build -t hakc-kali-image .
   or 
   docker build -t hakc-kali-image .
   ```
   `Success looks like this`
   ```
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 sudo docker build -t hakc-kali-image .

4. **Start Hacking**

- You can either run the `start_kali_hacking.sh` script 
   ```bash
   chmod 755 start_kali_hacking.sh
   ./start_kali_hacking.sh
   ```
- OR you can kick it off manually
   ```bash
   cd kali/
   docker run \
       -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \

       -p 5900:5900 \
       -p 8501:8501 \
       -p 6080:6080 \
       -p 8080:8080 \
       --name hakc-kali \
       -it hakc-kali-image
   ```
